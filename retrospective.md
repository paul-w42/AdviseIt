# Retrospective Sprint 1

### Successes

- Refactored code containing multiple if-statements into one loop for html generation
- happening upon the original data structure describing courses and requirements, graph-like, made it easier to conceptualize requirements and scheduling
- using javascript + html (and a little css) made for a very simple to iterate development environment


### Challenges

- Bugs!  Had some challenges regarding iterating through a steadily shrinking list of classes
- Managing multiple arrays, and using to test against prerequisites to account for scheduling conflicts
