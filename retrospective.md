# Retrospective Sprint 1

### Successes

- Refactored code containing multiple if-statements into one loop for html generation
- happening upon the original data structure describing courses and requirements, graph-like, made it easier to conceptualize requirements and scheduling
- using javascript + html (and a little css) made for a very simple to iterate development environment


### Challenges

- BUGS!  Had some challenges regarding iterating through a steadily shrinking list of classes
- Managing mulitple arrays testing against prerequisites to account for scheduling conflicts


### Backlog Changes vs Prior Sprint - (In Video report as well)

- we completed more stories than originally planned
- priorities for following sprint would be to provide a mechanism for the advisor or department to add/edit/remove classes and requirements

### Technical Progress Deliverables

- Demonstrate application functionality
    - including zero to many selected prerequisites
    - differing number of classes per quarter
    - with and without a summer quarter
- High level overview of technical work / solution
    - show / explain the ```courses.js``` file including its application towards class scheduling
    -
